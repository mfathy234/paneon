# Changelog

All notable changes to Paneon are listed here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Move panes. A **Move pane** button in each pane header lists every position, and Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Left / Right (Home /
  End for first / last) moves the focused pane. The order is saved with the workspace.
- Pane keyboard shortcuts: **Ctrl+Tab** and **Ctrl+Shift+Tab** cycle the panes, **Ctrl+1** to **Ctrl+9** jump to one.

### Changed

- Claude, Codex and Gemini sessions show their own logos instead of letter badges.

### Fixed

- The pane menu opened at the right edge of the grid for left and bottom panes. It now opens next to its button and
  flips up or left when there is no room.
- Esc closes a pane menu even when focus has moved off the menu.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-10-09

### Fixed

- Quitting no longer hangs: shutdown steps are time-limited and the app ends its own process after cleanup, with a
  watchdog backstop.
- Clicking the update pill right as the app refreshed could be ignored, leaving the update popover closed. The pill now
  keeps its parts in place between refreshes, so the click always lands.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- A command palette. **Ctrl+K** (or Ctrl+Shift+P) lists your open sessions, actions, projects, snippets and saved
  layouts in one fuzzy search. Up and Down move, Tab jumps to the next group, Enter runs, Esc closes, and the commands you
  ran last come first. Menus and shortcuts read the same command list. The key can be changed with `paletteShortcut` in
  `settings.json`.
- Saved layouts. The **Layouts** button in the top bar saves the current panes (project, agents, tabs, session ids, text
  size and order) under a name, and lists, opens, renames and deletes them. Opening asks whether to replace the current
  panes or add alongside them. Tabs with a session id resume it, the rest start fresh. From a terminal:
  `paneon open <layout>` and `paneon layouts`.
- Prompt snippets. A **Snippets** tab in Projects holds short prompts, global or for one project, with the variables
  `{{selection}}`, `{{branch}}`, `{{project}}` and `{{folder}}` and an optional **Alt+1** to **Alt+9** shortcut. Inserting
  types the text into the focused terminal without pressing Enter, as a bracketed paste when the agent supports it so
  that no line runs on its own. Snippets are also in the palette.
- Ask two agents. **Ask two agents...** (Ctrl+Shift+A, the split-button menu or the palette) sends one prompt to two agents
  and shows them side by side in a linked pair under a shared Compare header. Each can run in its own git worktree on a
  new branch. **Keep A**, **Keep B**, **Keep both** and **Diff A vs B** finish the comparison; closing a side and removing
  its worktree and branch each ask first, and a worktree with uncommitted files or commits is kept unless you confirm.
- Continue in another agent. A pane's menu and the palette offer **Continue in Codex / Gemini / Claude**. Paneon writes a
  summary (goal, files touched from git, plan and last check from the ops feed, last error and recent terminal output) that
  you can edit, then starts the other agent in the same folder with it as the first message. The new pane carries a
  **from <agent>** chip.
- A **Usage** view with today, 7 day and 30 day ranges. It reads Claude Code, Codex CLI and Gemini CLI history from their
  own folders and shows tokens per day (or hour) by agent, tokens and Claude Code cost by project and by agent, and a
  history of the 5 hour and weekly limits. Cost appears only where an agent reports one; nothing is estimated.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- In-app updates. The installed build checks GitHub Releases 10 seconds after start and every 6 hours, and shows an
  "Update" pill in the top bar. **Update now** downloads in the background while your sessions keep running, then
  **Restart now** (or quitting) installs it and your open sessions reopen. **Later** hides the pill until a newer version
  appears. The portable build only points you to the release page.
- An Updates section in the Theme popover: automatic checks on or off, a status line, **Check now** and **What's new**.
- A What's new dialog after an update, listing every release since the version you had before.

### Fixed

- Taskbar and notifications now show Paneon's own icon and name.
- Upgrading by hand from 0.3.0 now shows this What's new dialog too.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- Resume picker: a New | Resume switch in the quick-pick. Resume lists earlier sessions of Claude Code, Codex CLI and Gemini CLI
  across all projects, newest first and grouped by age, with search, an agent filter, a project filter and a preview of the
  first prompt and the last assistant message. Enter resumes in a new pane, Shift+Enter in the focused pane, Ctrl+R toggles
  New / Resume and Ctrl+Shift+R opens it directly. Sessions that are already open show "open in pane N" and are focused
  instead of started twice.
- Resume entry points in the split-button menu and in every project's menu, plus an empty state per project.
- A muted "resumed" chip in the pane header for the first minute of a session resumed from the picker.
- The `paneon` command: `open`, `.`, `start`, `resume`, `ls`, `sessions`, `add`, `update-agents`, `--help` and `--version`.
  The installer adds it to the user PATH and removes it on uninstall.
- First-run setup with two steps (add a project, check your agents), a `paneon .` tip, and a Getting started item in the
  Theme popover to reopen it.
- Second launches of the app forward their arguments to the running instance.

### Changed

- The project menu entry "Resume session..." now opens the resume picker filtered to that project.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- Paneon, formerly Claude Grid: a grid of real terminals for Claude Code, Codex CLI and Gemini CLI.
- Codex CLI and Gemini CLI sessions with titles, models, context and busy/idle state next to Claude Code.
- The Agents view with installed and latest versions and one-click install and update in a visible shell tab.
- Needs-you alerts: an amber border, taskbar flash and Windows notification when a session finishes or waits on a prompt.
- Optional status-line bridge and ops feed for plan progress, sub-agents, limits and changed files.
- Eight themes with contrast checks and an optional background image.

### Changed

- Renamed from Claude Grid to Paneon; settings are migrated from the old user-data folder on first start.
